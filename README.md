# DALTools
A collection of tools aimed to assist with modify files from many Date A Live Visual Novel mainly Rio Reincarnation.

## Download / Building
If you are here to just use the tools, You can grab the [lastest release from GitHub][releases_url] or compile them yourself.

**For the time being, you will need to build the tools for Date A Live: Ren Dystopia support**

**Releases**: You will need .NET Framework 4.6 or newer installed for them to run.
  
**Building**: You will need Visual Studio 2019 installed with the .NET Framework 4.6 Targeting Pack installed. 

## Issues / Requests
If you have found any issues with any of the tools in the repository or would like to request a feature or etc., Please don't hesitate to [submit an issue][newIssue_url]. 
When submitting an issue or a request, It is important to provide as much details as possible as it will help us to resolve your issue.

## PCKTool
PCKTool is a CLI tool which is designed to unpack and repack .pck archive seen in many of the Date A Live Visual Novels and some other games. 
For PC/PS4 .pck(s), you can unpack the archives by just dragging the archive file into PCKTool.exe. Repacking is the same process except you drag the archive folder into the executable. 
 
For Big Endian .pck(s) like the ones seen on the PS3, You will need to add the -e switch in the command line like ``PCKTool.exe -e Script.pck``

Special thanks to Sajid for helping me with figuring out the missing fields.


## TEXTool
TEXTool is a tool used to extract and rebuild Texture files.  
TEXTool does support extracting and rebuilding of .tex files using drag and drop and through CLI.  
using Drag and Drop, you can extract a .tex by dragging the .tex into the exe and rebuild it by dragging its .xml, .png or frames folder into the exe.  
You can get a list of options and examples by running TEXTool.exe without any arguments
```
  TEXTool [Switches] [-o {path}] {tex file}
  Switches:
    -p                             Exports all frames
    -s                             Exports Sheet as PNG
    -i                             Exports frame information
    -f {id}                        Exports a single frame
    -b {sheet.png} {frame.xml}     Build TEX using sheet and FrameXML
    -m {path}                      Build TEX using sheet and FrameXML (Search by name) (Recommended over -b)
    -e                             Read/Write in Big Endian (PS3) Default is Little Endian (PC/PS4)
    -c                             Disable overwrite check
    -o {path}                      Sets the output path
    -z                             Output 0x08 padded signatures over the default 0x14 (DAL: RR uses 0x14)
  Examples:
    TEXTool -p title.tex           Extracts all frames
    TEXTool -s title.tex           Extracts sheet from TEX
    TEXTool -s -e title.tex        Extracts sheet from a BE TEX (PS3)
    TEXTool -i title.tex           Extracts frame information
    TEXTool -b title.png title.xml Builds TEX using sheet
    TEXTool -m title               Builds TEX using frames
    TEXTool -f 0 title             Extracts the first frame
    TEXTool -p -o frames title.tex Extracts all frames into a folder called frames
```

## STSCTool
STSCTool is a tool used to disassemble and reassemble scripts (.bin), Currently scripts from Date A Live: Rio Reincarnation should work, other games will not work due to them having different instruction sets. 
 
To disassemble/reassemble scripts, just drag and drop the script(s) you want into STSCTool.exe which should generate a .txt or .bin file.
 
Scripts disassembled with STSCTool will produce a text file with a custom text syntax designed to be easily read back by the assembler and to be easy for the user to modify the code.

NOTE: If you are planning to using this tool for translation, Please checkout [ScriptDialogueEditor][scriptdialogueeditor_info_url] which is designed to make text editing process much easier to work with. 
  
These code files contain most of the instructions for the game to process, This includes stuff like, Story, Choices, Flagging, Music, Maps, Animation calling and etc. 
 
This repo has a small list some known functions in [FUNCTIONS.md][functions_url]

## FontEditor - Date A Live: Rio Reincarnation Font Editor
Incomplete, Can be used for editing font codes, but adding new character definitions do not work due to the game refusing to use the code for unknown reasons.
 
## ScriptDatabaseEditor - Date A Live: Rio Reincarnation Script Database Editor
A GUI tool made to allow editing the database.bin file located in the Script directory. The database file contains information mainly extras, menu and some common definitions like character and voice names. 
 
Note: This tool can also preview some resources if Date A Live: Rio Reincarnation is found installed.
 
Using this tool is easy, drag your database.bin file onto the exe file or run it alone for it to load your current script archive from your game installation (By default English will be loaded).

## ScriptDialogueEditor - DALTools Script Dialogue Editor
A GUI tool made to help simplify the process of editing the text within the scripts by basically integrating many of the tools needed into one GUI application.
